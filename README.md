These are some super-simple js exercises to cook into your brain a few specific things.

Read the comments for instructions and get the tests to pass, but make sure you understand why they do what they do.

A lot of this is about **reading code**. Programming languages are NOT for the computer, they are for the PROGRAMMER, so they can express what they want in a way they and other people can understand. If you write code that is hard for people to understand, you are doing it wrong.

Also means it is there to be read; not the comments, or the docs (althogh these can help) but the actual code itself. It does what it says 100% of the time (well, almost).
